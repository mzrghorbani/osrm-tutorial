# osrm-tutorial

An OSRM tutorial serves as a valuable resource for individuals, including students who may have limited coding knowledge. 

This comprehensive guide offers a systematic approach to understanding the fundamental principles and features of OSRM. 

By following the tutorial, users can gain proficiency in installing, configuring, and effectively utilising OSRM to compute routes and accomplish diverse routing tasks. 

The tutorial presents clear instructions and practical examples that enable users to swiftly grasp the core concepts of OSRM and effectively leverage its capabilities to fulfil their specific routing requirements.

The instructions provided in the OSRM tutorial are thoughtfully designed to follow a sequential order, where each task builds upon the previous one. It is crucial to go through the steps in a systematic manner, ensuring that each task is completed before moving on to the next. This structured approach allows users to gradually progress and develop a solid understanding of OSRM's functionalities and how they are interconnected.


# Clone OSRM Tutorial Repo

git clone https://github.com/mzrghorbani/osrm-tutorial.git


# Instructions

Even though OSRM installation no longer depends on sudoer, the Ubuntu system still needs admin access to install prerequisite applications.

There are two methods of installation available:

	by following the instructions in 'osrm-tutorial.ipynb'

,or

	executing the 'sudo ./install.sh' command in osrm-tutorial repository.


lease, see the printouts while the installation is in progress for further instructions.

During the execution of bash automation script, if the software installation failed for any reason (e.g., invalid url), please execute the commands present the install.sh script or osrm-tutorial.ipynb manually.

All commands in the bash script are also available in the notebook with descriptions.


# Good paractice: 

It is practical to open two terminals. One for running the Jupyter Notebook, and one for running the bash installation script or commands.


# Required files

The osrm-tutorial repository contains all the required files and scripts used in the tutorial.
