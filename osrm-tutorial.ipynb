You typically provide the OSM data file as input and specify the desired options, such as the profile to use and any additional restrictions or customizations.\n",

    "**Example command:**<br>\n",
    "osrm-extract map.osm.pbf -p profile.lua\n",

    "\n",
    "**osrm-partition:**<br>\n",
    "osrm-partition: This executable performs a spatial partitioning of the preprocessed street network data to enable efficient routing queries. It splits the data into smaller regions, which improves query performance. This step is optional but recommended for larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example command:**<br>\n",
    "osrm-partition map.osrm\n",
    "This step generates a .osrm.partition file that stores the partitioned data.\n",

    "**osrm-customize:**<br>\n",
    "This executable further optimizes the routing data to improve query performance. It modifies the preprocessed data based on heuristics and optimization techniques specific to OSRM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example command:**<br>\n",
    "osrm-customize map.osrm\n",
    "The output of this step is a final .osrm file that is ready for routing queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**osrm-routed:**<br> \n",
    "This executable starts the OSRM server, allowing you to make routing queries via HTTP requests or use the OSRM API. It loads the final .osrm file and provides a server interface to handle routing requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example command:**<br>\n",
    "osrm-routed map.osrm\n",
    "After executing this command, the OSRM server will start and listen for routing queries on a specified port (default is 5000).\n",
    "\n",
    "**osrm-contract:**<br>\n",
    "osrm-contract command should be executed after the osrm-extract step and before the osrm-routed step. It takes the preprocessed .osrm file as input and generates a contracted .osrm file.\n",
