    "\n",
    "`screen` is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to create multiple virtual terminal sessions within a single terminal window or SSH session. It provides a way to run commands and applications that need to keep running even after you disconnect from the terminal or SSH session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful commands in `screen`:\n",
    "\n",
    "screen: Start a new screen session.<br>\n",
    "Ctrl + A, C: Create a new window within the screen session.<br>\n",
    "Ctrl + A, N: Switch to the next window.<br>\n",
    "Ctrl + A, P: Switch to the previous window.<br>\n",
    "Ctrl + A, \": Show a list of all windows for easy selection.<br>\n",
    "Ctrl + A, A: Rename the current window.<br>\n",
    "Ctrl + A, D: Detach from the screen session (leave it running in the background).\n",
    "\n",
    "screen -r: Reattach to a detached screen session.<br>\n",
    "screen -ls: List all active screen sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "exit or Ctrl + D: Close a terminal session inside a screen window.\n",

    "Screen provides many more features and commands. You can refer to the screen documentation or use the man screen command for more detailed information.\n",

    "Here's an example of running the osrm-extract command in screen:\n",

    "1. In osrm-backend directory, start a new screen session with name osrm. \n",

    "```bash\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "$ osrm-extract great-britain-latest.osm.pbf --threads=10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Detach from the screen session by pressing Ctrl + A, then D. This leaves the process running in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reattach to the screen session later, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ screen -r osrm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will bring you back to the osrm screen session and allow you to check the progress or interact with the osrm-extract process.\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
